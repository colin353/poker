## Solo

Solo is an app that quizzes you on poker odds. It shows you a board state and
asks a question such as "what's the probability of winning?" or "what is the probability of
losing to three of a kind?".

If you guess the probability accurately, you get points, but if you're wrong, you lose them.

Once you get 1000 points, you level up. Each level gets more difficult questions and requires you
to be more accurate.
